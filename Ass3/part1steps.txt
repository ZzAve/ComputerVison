Stepwise guide

- set correct settings for HSV e1 d e2
- select suitable frame such that four 'perfect' voxel clusters are present
- perform clustering based on top view (reconstruction!)
- Repeat process a number of times with random starting points to ensure global max is found
- Project voxels on view. THINK ABOUT OCCLUSION!! 
	If two voxels are placed on a view, only consider the one closest!
- Make color model with HISTOGRAMS
